# Conventions overview


This guide represents the latest state of designs or in-product workflows. It is meant to be used as a source by anyone designing within the Keycloak admin console ecosystem, with the intention of creating a consistent experience. This documentation is meant to provide insight into the current conventions used in the product and, where applicable, document upcoming conventions. This guide also aims to show examples to give context for designing similar pages or workflows.

Note that: Keycloak admin console redesign uses [PatternFly4](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/about-modal/) as a pattern library and this guide does not replace PatternFly in any way â€“ it builds upon PatternFly. These conventions show how PatternFly components are combined to create Keycloak specific experiences.
